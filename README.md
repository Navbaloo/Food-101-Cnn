The Food-101 image classification project focuses on building a deep learning model capable of identifying and categorizing images of food into 101 distinct classes. 
Using the Food-101 dataset, which contains 101,000 images with significant visual diversity and real-world noise, this project aims to tackle the challenge of fine-grained image classification. 
By leveraging modern convolutional neural networks and transfer learning techniques, the model learns to distinguish between visually similar dishes such as paella, risotto, and bibimbap.
The project not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating classification performance on complex datasets but also lays the groundwork for practical applications in areas like restaurant menu recognition,
food delivery apps, and dietary tracking systems.
